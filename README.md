# stochastic_recurrent_neural_networks
This repository is about using stochastic recurrent neural networks (RNN) for optimizing COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the United States.

Mixture density network is added to RNN to create stochastic RNN.

All input data are available in the repository.

A package for calculating Effective Reproductive Numbers (Rt) is represented.

By running run you can get the results, performance of the model, and figures on the basis of both confirmed cases dataset and Rt dataset.

You can select either confirmed cases dataset or Rt dataset in utils file.
